                                    
                                    
                                    E-Cart FrontEnd
                                -----------------------


        1. Create a folder ECart
        2. Inside in it Create a Angular Application - ng new e-cart - FrontEnd
        3. cd e-cart - FrontEnd
        4. code .
        5. Run Angular Application ng s -o
        6. Clear code in app.component.html
        7. Import 3rd party Libraries

                ->Bootstrap (Index.html)
                ->Font-Awesome (index.js)
                ->google Fonts (style.css)
        
        8. lazzy Loading

           -Lazy Loading helps to keep initial bundle six=ze smaller
            which in turn helps decrease load times 
           -Lazy loading is an approach to limit the modules that are loaded to the ones that the user currently needs.
           This can improve your applications performance and reduce the initial bundle size.

        we have one module in our application - app.module
        here we create another module - ng g m products --route products -- module app.module

        9. Component Generation

            ->ng g c products/allProducts
            ->ng g c products/viewProducts
            ->ng g c products/wishlist
            ->ng g c products/cart
            Not in Lazzy Loading
            ->ng g c header
            ->ng g c footer
            ->ng g c PageNotFound
